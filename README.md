My idea of Chess in console :-)

This code in C works in console - draws chessboard with selector of figures 
and allow to move these figures with visual control of available moves. 

ver.0.1[07/Feb/2016]
- chessboard in console txt mode
- some figure selector in vertical menu
- visual control of available moves for some figures
